+The main objects of this study are twofold. First, the development of a PHP project to the program PHP Depend in order to derive metrics in an xml file and secondly to analyze the xml file via the program created in this work and import the metrics of the file into a database.<br><br>
+PHP_Depend is a small program that performs static code analysis on a given source base. Static code analysis means that PHP_Depend first takes the source code and parses it into an easily processable internal data structure. This data structure is normally called an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), that represents the different statements and elements used in the analyzed source base. Then it takes the generated AST and measures several values, the so called software metrics. Each of this values stands for a quality aspect in the analyzed software, observed from a very high level of abstraction, because no source was reviewed manually until now.<br><br>
+The analysis of the xml file, produced by PHP Depend, is done by using code that has been implemented in this work. The xml file is analyzed by parsing techniques and the metrics, that contains, are imported into a database.<br><br>
 For the implementation of this project, it was essential the knowledge and use of the program PHP Depend and technologies and programming languages for websites such as PHP, HTML, mySQL and Javascript, as well as the use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
